# WeatherApp

This project tells us weather conditions of a capital of any country.

## How to run this project on your machine
a.
1. Install gitbash. Watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdwWe9COT9k from 2 minutes 20 seconds.
2. Create and open a new folder, right click inside the folder and select git bash here. Copy my github repository link and type the command **git clone 'repositorylink'** (without '') and hit enter.
3. Either the files will be downloaded or a folder called weather-app will be created. We need to go inside the folder i.e. at the location where all files are present.

b.
1. Go to https://nodejs.org/en/ , download and install the 14.17.6 LTS version.
2. Open terminal (linux users) or command prompt as administrator (windows users) and type the command **npm install -g @angular/cli** and hit enter. This will install Angular CLI.

c.
1. Open gitbash inside "weather-app" folder and type the command **ng serve --o**. This will open a link in your browser. Type the name of capital (eg-kabul) for which you want to get weather data.
2. If the above command does not work, you can try **npm init** command first then try running above command.
